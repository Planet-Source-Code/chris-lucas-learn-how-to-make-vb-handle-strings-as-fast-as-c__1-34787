### Description

If you want your strings routines to be as fast as possible, learn C. If you don't want to learn C use string mapping, its nearly as fast and pure VB. In this article I give you the silver bullet for strings. If strings are bottlenecking your code, I'm your new best friend. I've included a project that attempts to visualize the string for you. It also contains a word count comparision which uses four methods string mapping being the fastest by far (compiled).
